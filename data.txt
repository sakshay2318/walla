I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if we could reschedule our upcoming meeting originally planned for [Original Date & Time]. Due to [Reason, if necessary], I won’t be able to attend at that time.

Would it be possible to move it to [New Proposed Date & Time]? Let me know if that works for you or if there’s another time that suits you better.

Looking forward to your response.
