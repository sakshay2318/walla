Autonomous Developer Security Coaching
Implement AI-powered bots that provide real-time security suggestions to developers as they code.
Example: A GitHub Copilot-like assistant that suggests secure code patterns dynamically.


 AI ChatOps for End-to-End Approvals
Enhance ChatOps to allow security approvals without human intervention by setting up predefined security policies.
Example: AI-powered Slack bot that automatically grants security approvals when all preconditions are met.

Dynamic Risk-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Move from static IAM policies to dynamic risk-based access control.
AI evaluates the risk score of a user/session and automatically adjusts access levels in real-time.

7. Continuous Adaptive Security Code Reviews
üîπ Real-Time Code Security Feedback Before PR
Instead of waiting for PR reviews, provide live security feedback in IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ) using AI-driven security bots.
Example: If a developer writes an insecure function, the IDE highlights the issue in real-time and suggests a secure fix.
üîπ Dynamic Risk-Based Security Review Automation
Low-risk commits get auto-approved, while high-risk commits trigger in-depth security reviews.
Example:
‚úÖ Changing CSS files? Auto-approve.
‚ùå Modifying authentication logic? Auto-escalate for manual review.

6. Automated Secure Code Fixes & Patch Generation
üîπ Auto-Fix for Security Issues with AI Patches
If a security issue is found in code review, automatically generate a secure patch and suggest it in the PR.
Example: If SQL Injection is detected, the system auto-rewrites the query with parameterized statements.
üîπ Zero-Touch Vulnerability Fix Deployment
If a vulnerability is found, trigger an automated hotfix deployment into staging.
Verify fixes automatically before merging into production.
