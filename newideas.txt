Autonomous Developer Security Coaching
Implement AI-powered bots that provide real-time security suggestions to developers as they code.
Example: A GitHub Copilot-like assistant that suggests secure code patterns dynamically.


 AI ChatOps for End-to-End Approvals
Enhance ChatOps to allow security approvals without human intervention by setting up predefined security policies.
Example: AI-powered Slack bot that automatically grants security approvals when all preconditions are met.

Dynamic Risk-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Move from static IAM policies to dynamic risk-based access control.
AI evaluates the risk score of a user/session and automatically adjusts access levels in real-time.
