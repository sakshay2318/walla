you can create a custom LLM that allows you to upload thousands of policies and query them effectively. Here’s how you can do it:

Approach 1: Using a Fine-Tuned LLM
Fine-tune an existing open-source LLM (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral, Falcon) on your policy documents.
This makes the model “aware” of your policies and improves its contextual understanding.
Requires a lot of compute power (GPU-based training).
Approach 2: Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Recommended)
Instead of fine-tuning, you can use a retrieval-based approach to provide policy context dynamically:

Store Policies in a Vector Database

Use FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, or ChromaDB to store embeddings of policy documents.
Convert each policy document into vector embeddings using OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or local models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from SentenceTransformers.
Query Processing with Semantic Search

When a query is made, search for the most relevant policy sections using similarity search in the vector database.
Retrieve the most relevant sections and feed them into the LLM’s prompt (context window).
Generate Contextual Responses

Use a local LLM (e.g., Mistral, Llama-2, GPT4All, Ollama-based models) or an API-based model like GPT-4 to process the retrieved content.
The LLM generates responses only based on the retrieved policy documents, improving accuracy and compliance.
Benefits of RAG over Fine-Tuning
✅ No need for extensive training – Avoids costly GPU-based model training.
✅ Easier to update – Just add new policies to the vector DB instead of re-training the model.
✅ More accurate and interpretable – Always retrieves relevant policy sections before answering.
