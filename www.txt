Slide 2: My Approach ‚Äì Hybrid Security Scanning Script
Title: üõ†Ô∏è My Contribution: Custom Script-Based Security Scanner

Regex-based pattern scanning with AST validation

Over 3000+ patterns across Java, Scala, and JavaScript

11 scan categories (IDOR, Role-Based Access, etc.)

Dev-friendly options: add patterns, exclude paths, choose languages

Findings stored in JSON, exported as PDF/CSV, with a UI manager

Slide 3: Challenges I Faced
Title: ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenges During Development

Regex matches alone created too many false positives

AST validation integration was technically complex

Creating reliable, scalable patterns for 3 languages took time

UI/UX for developers to review findings needed clear workflows

Syncing with QA/devs to validate patterns was time-intensive

Slide 4: Teamwork & Impact
Title: ü§ù Collaborating for Secure Code

Worked closely with QA & developers to refine test cases

Designed tool to be plug & play for any microservice team

Empowered devs to self-review security flaws early

Feedback loop helped us evolve new patterns & detection logic

Slide 5: Learnings & Expectations
Title: üéØ Key Takeaways from My Internship

Learned how static & dynamic analysis really work in practice

Understood importance of dev-friendly security tooling

Gained hands-on with AST parsing, regex tuning, JSON reporting

Expected to drive independent research, own delivery, and cross-team coordination
